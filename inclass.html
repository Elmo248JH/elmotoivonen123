        <h2>Bernie Eccelstone.</h2>
        
        Bernard "Bernie" Charles Ecclestone (born 28 October 1930) is an English business magnate. He is the former chief executive of the Formula One Group, 
        which manages Formula One motor racing and controls the commercial rights to the sport, and part-owns Delta Topco, 
        the previous ultimate parent company of the Formula One Group. As such, he was commonly described in journalism as the 'F1 Supremo'.
        <p>
            Bernie has faced lots of critcism for his opinions, particluarly towrards drivers due to their different ethnic backgrounds, or their gender. He's also made 
            several positive remarks towards Adolf Hitler and Vladimir Putin. The media has dubbed Eccelstone: 
            "F1's King of Controversy"
